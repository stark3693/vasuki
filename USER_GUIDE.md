## How to Access VSK Token Claiming and Voting

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
1. **Open the application** in your browser
2. **Look for the wallet connection button** (usually in the top-right corner)
3. **Click "Connect Wallet"** and select your preferred wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
4. **Approve the connection** in your wallet

### Step 2: Access Token Claiming
Once your wallet is connected, you can access VSK token claiming:

#### Prediction Polls Page (Main Location)
1. **Navigate to "Prediction Polls"** from the sidebar or navigation
2. **Look for the "VSK Token Claimer" card** at the top
3. **Click "Claim Tokens"** to get 1000 VSK tokens

### Step 3: Claim Your VSK Tokens
1. **Click the "Claim Tokens" button**
2. **Confirm the transaction** in your wallet (you'll pay gas fees)
3. **Wait for the transaction to complete**
4. **You'll receive 1000 VSK tokens** in your wallet

### Step 4: Vote on Polls
1. **Browse available prediction polls**
2. **Click on a poll** to view details
3. **Click "Vote"** to open the voting modal
4. **Select your prediction** and optionally stake tokens
5. **Confirm your vote** in your wallet

**Important**: When you vote with staking, the staked VSK tokens will be deducted from your balance. This means your VSK balance will decrease by the amount you stake.

## Troubleshooting

### "No Token Claiming Option Visible"
